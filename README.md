[1]Exploitation of heuristics for virtual environments
http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2399065

Nielsen's heuristics have been tremendously popular
Computer scientists are more likely to invent new methods than to evaluate current ones.
Sutcliffe and Gault proposed 12 heuristics
those 12 are: 
Natural engagement,
Compatibility with the user's tasks and domain,
Natural expression of action,
Close coordination of action and representation,
Realistic feedback,
Faithful viewpoints,
Navigation and orientation support,
Clear entry and exit points,
Consistent departures,
Support for learning,
Clear turn-taking,
Sense of presence.

The authors of this paper: Ebba, Gyda and Jan proposed that the current heuristic approach to dealing with data was being abused and not understood.

Article seemed to be about using a heuristic approach to analyse feedback for a crisis management training simulator


[2]Investigating the balance between virtuality and reality in Mobile Mixed Reality Design
http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2641201

Milgram and Kishino stated that they believe virtuality to be furthest from reality but now there is Augmented reality which is a mix of both.
They had 2 objectives for their research of MMR UX which were:
to investigate if there were differences in user perceptions
and, if found, to chart what was perceived as potential strengths and weaknesses of each approach from the UX point of view.

the study they undertook consisted of:
written survey of the background information
interactive tasks with the simulated mobile application
assessing user perceptions with location based annotations
written end survey

most participants found the 3d model on their phone easier to interact with than the real life equivalent.
however 84% of respondents to the online survey said they preferred the live camera view
and 69% of respondents to the field study said they also preferred the live camera view

reasons for this were that the live camera view was perceived to be more realistic and therefore more immersive.
associating with the environment is easier than with the 3d animated model

Reasons for choosing the 3d modeled view included clearer visibility in darker areas and less people intruding so as not to get in the way of the camera.
two out of eighteen participants said that a combination of the two UIs would be perfect

The 3D model view was stated to be better in Clarity and Usability but worse in Utility, Understability and Pleasantness

[3]Hardware Interfaces for VR applications
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363283

DREAMS and EREBUS were the names of the games that were tested.
Both the games were developed in Unreal Engine 4, Dreams used an xbox one wireless controller and Erebus was play tested using the Hydra controllers. They chose to develop the games in UE4 because Unreal had just brought out the capabilities to develop for VR and AR technology. The users they tested the gameplay on were 18 students with a background of gaming, so they had a good depth of knowledge in gaming. The students reported that they initially felt comfortable using the xbox one controller but in time and with guidance on how to use the Hydra controller, both were equally comfortable and easy to use.
Users reported feeling more motion sickness playing the Erebus game while wearing the Oculus Rift headset than when they were playing Dreams. This was partly because Dreams had better compatibility for the Hydra controller but also because the Dreams user interface was just better optimised overall. They finish with talking about what the future is for VR and AR technology, particularly in the gaming industry.

[4]Re-examination of Multimodal Augmented Reality
http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=3001961

Many different categories of reality:
Reality,
Virtuality,
Mixed reality,
Augmented Virtuality,
Mixed Reality,
Mixed Mobile Reality.

Talks about Milgram and Kishino needing a distinction between these different realities.
Three things are stated to be the difference between reality and virtuality:
Real objects exist objectively, a virtual object does not formally exist.
Real objects can be viewed regardless of any medium being used, virtual objects require specific mediators to be viewed.
The basis of AR must be a real environment with added augmentations of virtual objects.
An example of a father viewing his real daughter in the real world as a virtual representation in a different room can have the following variations:
Real and displayed in the real world
Virtual and displayed in the real world
Real and displayed in a video feed
Virtual and displayed in a video feed
Real and virtual displayed in the real world




[5]Real Virtuality: A Code of Ethical Conduct. Recommendations for Good Scientific Practice and the Consumers of VR-Technology

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00003/full

This paper describes how the environment which a person is interacting with can change how the person thinks and feels. In more detail, they explain the effects of long-term immersion, neglect of the social and physical environment, risky content and privacy issues.
The authors go into detail about how this new technology in the market could bring with it new dangers and risks to the user’s health. Particularly, the well-being of the user’s psychological state as they delve more and more into an ever increasing world made to look realistic.
Some concerns stem from the fact that when placed in the body of an avatar that looks unlike the user, they may become dysphoric or have a great sense of unease with their body. However, the opposite of this could also pose hazards, as identical avatars could blur the lines between reality and virtuality.
Virtual Reality technology also creates opportunities for misconduct in the online world, similar to when social media exploded in popularity and we saw this new wave of bullying called cyber-bullying, it’s possible that VR could introduce something far more dangerous as the user feels more immersed in the world.


[6]Homuncular Flexibility in Virtual Reality.
http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=203120d4-3c9e-4014-842a-9051b3f67dab%40sessionmgr103&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=102884181&db=ufh

The authors in this paper focus on the ability VR/AR has for people to inhabit virtual avatar bodies of the in game character and how this affects the person’s mind, mood and behaviour.
A specific example used is becoming a bat; what if a person was so immersed in a game that they believed their body had changed to being a bat?
Homuncular Flexibility is exactly that, it focuses on how the human body seems to adapt to what it sees. 
Examples of when the body is tricked by the mind (and vice versa) is when an amputee’s experience phantom pains or they believe they have feeling in a limb which isn’t there/isn’t under their control. This can be seen with the rubber glove experiment where a person’s hand is unknowingly placed next to a fake hand but then claims to experience what the fake hand is experiencing.

Overall
Virtual reality and Augmented reality are becoming more available to the consumer, while also becoming more sophisticated. Analysis on VR/AR is widely varied as the research is primarily done by computer scientists who have a habit of creating new research methods rather than evaluating older ones, however most seem to build on Nielsen’s heuristics approach to VR/AR[1].

When users were asked to try applications which involved both real camera feeds and virtual 3D modeled feeds of the same area, most said that the real feed provided more information and was clearer but the 3D modeled feed was easier to interact with[2]. This could become problematic in the future when even though reality is clearer and gives more information, people will choose the virtual reality as it is easier to interact with.

Particularly given the fact that a holographic display of a real girl could soon be easier to interact with than the real girl right next to you[4]. After some time using any particular controller, with enough guidance, the user seems to become familiar with it and feels comfortable using it [3]. If this could be applied to the anecdote of the father wearing the HMD to interact with his daughter then it could result in people abandoning face to face interaction in favour of VR/AR interaction[3][4].

Lastly, if we as users become familiar and comfortable with using HMDs for everyday tasks then what effect is that going to have on our mental wellbeing? Prolonged exposure to immersive environments in a virtual reality can have a detrimental effect on one’s mental state, particularly if you combine this with the dyspraxic effects of an avatar that looks different to your own[5][6].
